Welcome to the Used Car Lot Project! 

Suppose you are the owner of a large used car lot and want some insights on how you can profit or cut costs next month. With this app, you can see what cars need to get pushed out the lot first, or what price range the worst conition of car has, etc. 

Notice how both interactive graphs give you the opportunity to select 'days_listed'. This is so you can push the cars that have been on the lot the longest- they are costing you money! 

You are able to select the model of the car, the model year range, their odometer reading, their condition, and how long they have been listed. Poke around and see what possibilities there are!
